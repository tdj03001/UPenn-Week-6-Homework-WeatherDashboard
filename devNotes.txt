- Allow "City, State" input
- Enable clicking of recent searches to perform search
- Add alert when city not found
- When city not found, don't add that city to the page
- When city not found, don't add that city to local storage
- The jQuery click event for searchAgain should be able to identify the element clicked by it's dynamically created
   class or ID, so, need to implement dynamically created class or ID when adding recent cities to the page list
