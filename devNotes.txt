Enhancements:
- Get more than one previous search stored locally
- Display all local storage items on page load/refresh
- Limit displayed results from local storage to 5
- Enable clicking of recent searches to perform search
- Add alert when city not found
- Allow "City, State" input
- When searching city after city, local storage adds to array no problem. BUT, once refreshed, the first new search resets local storage. Need to fix this so page load doesn't create a new array
